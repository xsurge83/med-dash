                Over the last 2-3 years InfraSonic Monitoring have been working on the development of a non-invasive,
                ambulatory, cardiac output monitor. The primary challenges in obtaining a proof of concept was
                establishing accurate heart contraction timing, such that confounding factors such as breathing motions,
                speech noise, and other impact spikes (such as would occur during ambulation) would not interfere with
                the stroke volume calculation.
            </p>

            <p> Currently we develop an ambulatory cardiac output monitor prototype for two different groups. An
                athletic product which emphasize performance improvement, and a health care product for monitoring the
                at-risk population...</p>
